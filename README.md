# CovidTCRs
The analysis of the TCR repertoires of COVID-19 patients.

To replicate the figures and tables of the analysis, the processed dataset with TCR-epitope specificity predictions
*SplitMixed_mergedCD8_scaled_weekMax*, located in the *data* folder of the repository, is sufficient.

The raw TCR sequencing data can be found here: [SRA link]. Assembled TCR sequences can be found in the folder 
data/splitDS_IMSEQ/TCRex_format_meta_TRB.
